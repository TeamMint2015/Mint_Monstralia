Under Assets/Animation/Green Monster

There is Monster_1_GREEN.psd.
This is a photoshop file that has all the decomposition of the Green Monster Character.
If you have photoshop, it can be opened. I've attached a screen shot of Photoshop 
with the file opened so you can what's in the file.

The file allows us to create different frames for Sprint 2.
