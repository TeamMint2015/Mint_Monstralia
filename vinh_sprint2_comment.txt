For Sprint 2
Under Assets/Animation/Green Monster
Different frames were created from the decomposition of a static picture of a monster in sprint one.
Arm movements are in this folder and facial expressions for the monster is what I worked on.
The pictures were sent to Nathan to pre-liminary testing, but they ended working great, so Nathan uploaded the artifact with his code.
